nothing is true?
everything is possible
any of ever possible
will bring your happiness

Look
If you had
One shot
Or one opportunity
=======
rusted from the rain
common, crush me liking flavour
=======
with the bird i'll share this lonely wievin'

There's no money, there's no possessions
Only obsession, I don't need that shit
Take my money, take my obsession
